/// This class uses CFHost to query an IP address for its DNS names.  To do this:
///
/// 1. Create the `HostNameQuery` object with the IP address in question.
///
/// 2. Set a delegate.
///
/// 3. Call `start()`.
///
/// 4. Wait for `didComplete(names:hostNameQuery:)` or `didComplete(error:hostNameQuery:)` 
///    to be called.
///
/// CFHost, and hence this class, is run loop based.  The class remembers the run loop on which you 
/// call `start()` and delivers the delegate callbacks on that run loop.
///
/// - Important: Reverse DNS queries are notoriously unreliable.  Specifically, you must not 
///   assume that:
///
///   - Every IP address has a valid reverse DNS name
///   - The reverse DNS name is unique
///   - There's any correlation between the forward and reverse DNS mappings
///   
///   Unless you have domain specific knowledge (for example, you're working in an enterprise 
///   environment where you know how the DNS is set up), reverse DNS queries are generally not 
///   useful for anything other than logging.
