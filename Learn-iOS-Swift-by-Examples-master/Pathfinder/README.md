# Pathfinder: Pathfinding Basics

This sample demonstrates how to use GameplayKitâ€™s pathfinding features to map out a game world and find paths through it. 

## Playing the game

Tap anywhere (iOS), press any key (OS X), or click the Siri Remote touch surface (tvOS) to show the solution for the displayed maze. Tap/click again to generate a new maze.

## Structure

The `MazeBuilder` class implements a general algorithm for random maze generation, creating 2D mazes expressed through `GKGridGraph` objects. 

The `Maze` class represents a generated maze, and its `solution` property getter uses `GKGraph.findPathFromNode(_:toNode:)` to obtain a path through the maze.

The `GameScene` class generates a visual representation of each `Maze` object, animates the display of maze solutions, and handles events to display/solve new mazes.

## Requirements

### Build

Xcode 7 with OS X 10.11, iOS 9.0, or tvOS 9.0 SDK

### Runtime

OS X 10.11, iOS 9.0, or tvOS 9.0
