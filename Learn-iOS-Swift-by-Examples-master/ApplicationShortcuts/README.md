# Application Shortcuts: Using UIApplicationShortcutItem

## Summary

Demonstrates how to use the `UIApplicationShortcutItem` class in your application so users can quickly access parts of an application through “Quick actions” from the Home screen.
It implements four different shortcuts, two static defined (`UIApplicationShortcutItem`) in your Info.pist, two dynamic or mutable (`UIMutableApplicationShortcutItem`) defined through code.  The mutable shortcuts can be edited to change their title, subtitle and icon.

IMPORTANT: This sample should be run on an iPhone 6s or 6s Plus device or later. The iOS simulator will allow use of the shortcuts through its Hardware -> Touch Pressure menu, which requires a Trackpad.

## Requirements

### Build

iOS 11.0 SDK, Xcode 9.0
