# ForceTouchCatalog: Using the Force Touch Trackpad API

Demonstrates how to use the Force Touch Trackpad APIs. This sample is divided into three levels of mastery through which youâ€™ll learn how to process pressure events, perform spring loading, configure the trackpad, and perform feedback.

## Structure

Squire: Accelerator and Multi-Level Accelerator buttons. Drag and Drop spring loaded buttons.  

Knight: A drawing view that uses the new pressure event in its tracking loop to change the size of the brush.  

Master: Modified drawing view that configures the trackpad to not force click and provide a better pressure mapping for drawing purposes. Also, provides an example of how to manually perform haptic feedback on the Force Touch trackpad when an image is rotated to 0 degrees.
